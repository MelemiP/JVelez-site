Made UX and Accessibility changes to Instagram logo. 
At the time of editing, the logo link to Instagram was the only way to connect to the photographer on the site. The previous logo design made it nearly impossible to find before, plus it had not been mobile optimized. 
By layering vector images beneath the logo and increasing the size of the logo, the logo is much easier to see and find. 
I adjusted the placement of the logo for mobile, and adjusted the footer on both desktop and mobile for the best combination of access, visibility, and aesthetic.
